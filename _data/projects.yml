  summary_short: >
    A wearable navigation system combining RGB-D vision, real-time mapping, and haptic feedback,
    extended with EEG tagging to assess user cognitive load during navigation.
  summary_long: >
    This project developed and evaluated a wearable robotic navigation aid designed to assist
    visually impaired users. The system integrated an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera for depth
    perception, ROS for mapping/localisation, and microcontrollers for haptic actuators.
    Multiple feedback strategies were compared under controlled scenarios. An EEG logging pipeline
    synchronised haptic events and motor commands with the EEG timeline to correlate cognitive
    load with navigation difficulty, providing insight into usability and mental workload.

  summary_short: >
    Competitive ANYmal robot control in a class sumo tournament using PPO and curriculum learning, delivered as part
    of Prof. Jemin Hwangbo’s Reinfocement Learning-based control module at KAIST.
  summary_long: >
    Agents were trained in raisimGym to compete head-to-head in a sumo-style arena. The project
    built on formal teaching of on-policy vs off-policy methods, Q-functions, policy gradients, and
    SGD/Adam optimisation. I implemented a PPO baseline and curriculum scheduling to improve robustness,
    yielding behaviours such as a leap attack that proved decisive in the class tournament. Results
    included learning curves, trajectory visualisations, and reproducible configs.

  toc_title: Custom FEA Solver
  status: past
  start_date: "2024-09-01"
  end_date: "2024-12-12"
  stack: [Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PyVista, Gmsh]
  summary_short: >
    A custom 2D wing-section FEA solver built in Python: geometry generation; Gmsh meshing;
    quadrature-based assembly; stress and deformation visualisation and geometry/material optimisation.
  summary_long: >
    The package implements a full FEA pipeline with orthotropic elasticity, Gaussian quadrature,
    sparse global assembly, Dirichlet boundary conditions at the root, and stress recovery
    (principal, Von Mises, shear). Differential-evolution explores geometric angles (θ, ϕ) and
    material parameters (E1, E2, G12); multiprocessing parallelises evaluations over design points.
    Outputs include ParaView VTK files, sparsity plots, and eigenmode analysis for bending/torsion.

  stack: [Python, PyTorch, Gymnasium, NumPy, Matplotlib, Flask/Streamlit, Plotly, WebSocket, Unity-MLAgents, PyBullet]
  summary_short: >
    An end-to-end RL platform unifying gridworld and 3D tasks with PPO training, live telemetry
    (web dashboard), and reproducible evaluation with saved rollouts, plots, and videos.
  summary_long: >
    The pipeline standardises env interfaces (reset/step/render), provides tabular and PPO baselines,
    streams metrics and frames to a Flask/Streamlit dashboard via WebSockets, and stores artefacts
    (checkpoints, logs, figures, videos) under timestamped runs. Config-driven experiments ensure
    determinism and comparability across 2D/3D tasks.

  summary_short: >
    Assessed the feasibility of tidal and wind arrays in the Severn Estuary, from resource assessment to turbine design, topographic optimisation and the overall levelised cost of energy.
  summary_long: >
    Site feasibility was built from bathymetry of the Severn Estuary and wind data from the Bristol
    Channel. My contributions: (1) modelling tidal and wind array performance to maximise capture
    and reliability, (2) designing a condition-monitoring strategy to reduce O&M, and
    (3) LCOE analysis benchmarking economic viability under grid constraints. Simulations compared
    capacity factor, downtime resilience, and layout variants; results support the potential of
    marine + wind renewables for industrial repowering in the region.
