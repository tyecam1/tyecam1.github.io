# Current work (planned/new)
- key: rl-nav
  title: RL Navigation (Gridworld)
  status: current
  year: 2025
  stack: [Python, PyTorch, Gymnasium, NumPy, Matplotlib]
  summary_short: Agent learns obstacle-aware shortest paths; plots, policy heatmaps, and trajectory animations.
  summary_long: A reproducible gridworld environment with tabular baseline and room for PPO. Includes metrics (return, success rate, steps-to-goal), policy/value visualisations, and training diagnostics.
