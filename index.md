# Hi, I’m Tye

I’m a first-class (international) engineering masters graduate from Cardiff University with a KAIST exchange term.  
I build **robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, and **systems** projects — shipping clean code, clear docs, and runnable demos.

**What I’m building right now**
- **RL Navigation (Gridworld)** — agent learns obstacle-aware shortest paths (plots + GIFs).
- **Robotics Telemetry Dashboard** — real-time simulated robot data in a web UI (Flask/Plotly).
- **RL Agent in Game** — Unity ML-Agents baseline for simple control (video demo).

## Featured Projects

### WalkAide — Assistive Navigation Prototype
- **Stack:** ROS, Intel RealSense (RGB-D), Python, Arduino (earlier), EEG logging  
- **What:** Wearable navigation experiments combining RGB-D perception with haptic feedback; EEG tagging for cognitive-load insights.  
- **Repo:** <https://github.com/tyecam1/Mechatronic-Walkaide>

### KAIST RL-Based Control — Quadruped ANYmal Sumo
- **Stack:** PyTorch, RaisimGym, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **What:** PPO baselines and curriculum-learning experiments for competing ANYmal-inspired agents.  
- **Repo:** <https://github.com/tyecam1/KAIST-Anymal-Sumo>

### FEM Wing Analysis — Geometry & Stress
- **Stack:** Python (NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib), custom FEA, sparse optimisation  
- **What:** 2D wing geometry generator, constraint handling, principal stress evaluation, area targeting.  
- **Repo:** <https://github.com/tyecam1/AircraftWing-FEM-Solver>
