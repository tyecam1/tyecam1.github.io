# Hi, I’m Tye

I’m a First-Class (International) MEng graduate from Cardiff University with a KAIST exchange term.  
I build **robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, and **systems** projects — focusing on clean code, clear documentation, and reproducible results.

## Current Work

**RL Navigation (Gridworld)**  
Agent learns obstacle-aware shortest paths in a 2D environment. Planned outputs include training curves, policy heatmaps, and animated trajectories.  

**Robotics Telemetry Dashboard**  
A simulated telemetry system streaming robot state (speed, yaw, battery) into a live web dashboard using Flask/Plotly.  

**RL Agent in Game**  
Using Unity ML-Agents to train a baseline PPO agent for a simple control task. Results will include video demonstrations.
