# Hi, I’m Tye 👋

I’m a First-Class (International) Masters graduate from Cardiff University with a KAIST exchange term.  
I build **robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, and **systems** projects — shipping clean code, clear docs, and runnable demos.

**What I’m building right now**
- 🚥 **RL Navigation (Gridworld)** — agent learns obstacle-aware shortest paths (plots + GIFs).
- 📊 **Robotics Telemetry Dashboard** — real-time simulated robot data in a web UI (Flask/Plotly).
- 🎮 **RL Agent in Game** — Unity ML-Agents baseline for simple control (video demo).

### KAIST Reinforcement Learning-based Control — Quadruped Agent Sumo Arena
- **Stack:** PyTorch, RaisimGym, numpy, matplotlib  
- **What:** From tabular Q-learning to PPO baselines; curriculum experiment with simulated competing quadruped ANYmal agents.  
- **Repo:** <https://github.com/tyecam1/KAIST-Anymal-Sumo>

### FEM Wing Analysis — Geometry & Stress
- **Stack:** Python (numpy/scipy/matplotlib), custom FEA, sparse optimisation  
- **What:** 2D wing geometry generator, constraint handling, principal stress evaluation, area targeting.  
- **Repo:** <https://github.com/tyecam1/AircraftWing-FEM-Solver>
