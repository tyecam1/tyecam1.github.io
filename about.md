# About Me

I grew up on the Isle of Wight, surrounded by natural beauty and a community that valued both **creativity** and **sustainability**. True to those roots, my first piece of academic work was an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) at age 17, titled *“Tidal Energy on the Isle of Wight”*. It was a technical deep dive into tidal energy conversion devices, their local applicability, and a comparison with other sustainable energy technologies.

Despite a lifelong love for coding, I enrolled in **Mechanical Engineering** at Cardiff University to keep my options broad and to build a career where my work could come to life in the physical world. During my degree, I undertook an industrial placement at Bosch Thermotechnology within the Quality department. There I learned the value of **continuous improvement**, alongside practical skills in test rig control and sensor integration.

After Bosch, I pursued a more technical path and was awarded a place at KAIST — **South Korea’s leading technology university**. There I studied advanced topics in robotics, reinforcement learning, and AI for physical systems. KAIST’s competitive curved marking system challenged me more than any other period of my life and drove a period of significant personal and academic growth.

On returning, I completed my Master’s degree at Cardiff University (awarded with **First Class Honours**), where I excelled in simulation, sustainable energy system design, and mechatronics systems design.

## Where I Am Now

I’m currently based on the Isle of Wight, reviewing the best opportunities to pursue a **technically stimulating and rewarding career** in robotics, reinforcement learning, or sustainable systems. I continue to grow my portfolio through independent projects that combine my two passions: engineering physical systems and programming intelligent control.
